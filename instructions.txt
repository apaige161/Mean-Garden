FIX THESE THINGS
- recipes 500 -- internal server error
    - I think it has to do with the image or image path
    - removing recipe section for now

move code into production branch


-UI issues
create a garden page
-display per foot on hover
- fix mobile view of plants -- replace with dropdown?
- fix mobile view of remove column

on gardens page
-increase the size of progress bar 
    -90%+
- center the plant name


--Continue adding the dropdown into main2.component
-html is there but needs some configuration in the .ts file
